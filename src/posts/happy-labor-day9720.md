Holiday work, but I enjoyed the day.  Got some good work in and feeling good about my tasks.  Have an interesting choice to make soon, on whether I can/should continue with this internship.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
It was a somewhat lighter day, given the holiday, but we are working to get a build out to the stores ASAP and are bugcatching.  I started by reviewing some PRs, working on some bugs I found while testing a new dev build this morning, and reviewing an upcoming feature we'll have to work on.
<br>
<br>
Then we had some company and dev team meetings, albiet lightly attended.  We planned some sprint activities, and basically, for the next few days I'll be working on bugs and trying to field our Sentry and Usability channels.
<br>
<br>
After that, we will be ejecting from expo and then will have to heavily refactor quite a lot.  I know there will also be some development growing pains as well as we all get used to Android Studio and XCode.  I am worried about what issues I'll face in not being able to use XCode/iOs.  It'll be good to know the limitations I face, though.
<br>
<br>
Our dev team lead will also be away for our second weekly meeting and asked me to lead it.  Excited for that.  I like the members of our team quite a lot, and I think it'll be a good learning experience to lead this type of meeting.
<br>
<br>

####Decision Time
<br>
<br>
Soon, I'm going to have to make a choice on whether I can stick with this project.  They're shooting for funding in November, but I can't really afford to be in an unpaid situation much longer.  It does feel great that they would be hiring me on if they get funding, and also trusting me as a team lead.  I like pretty much everyone who works here, and the company culture too for the most part.
<br>
<br>
It's just unfortunate that finances will come in the way.  Of course, if we don't get funding, that's that.  But I might not be able to even go that far.  I'll have to continue to think on it.  It's too bad they can't do a sort of round of pre-funding to allow for this stage of the company.
