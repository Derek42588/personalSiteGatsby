####March 2019 - May 2019
<br>
<br>
So, by this point, I had taken a few courses and was starting to understand some basics.  I believe around this time was when I tried to write my <a href = "http://old-portfolio-dcp.herokuapp.com/">first portfolio site</a>, written using Node, JS, and basic HTML/CSS.  Github repo found <a href = "https://github.com/Derek42588/PersonalSite">here</a>
<br>
<br>
I knew a little bit and was eager to write my first project.  One that would be mine, written completely from scratch, and not using any sort of code-along videos.  I decided it would be with React, so I could finally get some experience with it, and write with an "impressive" tool.  
<br>
<br>

####Blackjack Training App
<br>
<br>
It's hard to think of project ideas!  To be honest, I still struggle with it.  You want to show off concepts you know, but you also don't want to do the same thing that people have done hundreds of times.  Moreover, its hard when you're just starting out to think of something that's not simply too big for you to do complete properly/on your own at your current skill level.
<br>
<br>
I remember after learning a bit of GraphQL, I was ready to implement my first "big" app idea.  I had a .json of something like 20,000 episodes worth of Jeopardy! episodes.  GraphQL was fancy, new (to me), sleek, and just what I needed to properly make my idea work !  I'd make a web app of, essentially, Jeopardy.  It'd show my being able to use APIs, cloud DBs, React/Redux and GraphQL -- what a great showcase!
<br>
<br>
Except my basic knowledge of all these libraries were fine for making Todo apps and basic queries, but nowhere near what I'd need to make a live, fully formed app like what I saw in my head.  
<br>
<br>
I'm digressing, but I guess my point is looking back at it now -- I made <a href = "https://react-blackjack-dcp.firebaseapp.com/">this blackjack app</a> and was disappointed in its simplicity (to say nothing of its design), but this is really what I needed to do at that stage at my learning, and need to continue to do.  Don't try to make huge apps with insane amounts of features -- spending months at a time in frustration when making small, incremental projects can do so much more for your education.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
Github repo for the blackjack app is <a href = "https://github.com/Derek42588/react-blackjack">here</a>.  It isn't much, but for a first project, and with the added experience I have now, I think it was a great first app.  The basic premise of the app is that it plays you a full game of Blackjack.  You as the player vs. a dealer, buying in for your own specified amount at your own specified bet.  Moreover, it would show you the "book" on request -- i.e., given the current hand, what is the recommended action.
<br>
<br>
It might not be multi-featured or fancy, but it definitely did show a certain amount of knowledge.  I'd have to write many JS functions for the game logic, and by making it live/responsive, show that I could use React -- props and state, new components depending on the view/game state, etc.
<br>
<br>
For someone near the same level in their own self-teaching, I definitely recommend a similar app.  Find something small, but still somewhat robust.  Have it do one central thing, but do it fully, from beginning to end.
<br>
<br>

####Some More Courses
<br>
<br>
For this project, I definitely remember referencing the code within the code-along project in Maximilian Schwarzmuller's <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/">React - The Complete Guide</a> to help refine what I was trying to accomplish.  This particular course I never finished all the way through, because I beleive at certain points I was either focusing fully on personal projects, or then different courses, but I would definitely recommend it.  40.5 hours of content and comprehensive.
