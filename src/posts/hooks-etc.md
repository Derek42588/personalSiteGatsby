Continued on with the course I have been taking.  Most of the content that I got through today had to do with Hooks.  I am familiar with the topic and have even used them before in my projects.  
<br>
<br>
Most of what I had been familiar with was, of course, the most common hooks, useState and useEffect.  I've definitely got a better grasp on useEffect after today.  First, what the second argument array really represents.  In the past, I've only ever seen it utilized in the sense of what it could be compared to in a Class based component - e.g., pass in an empty array to have it act like componentDidMount, and so on.
<br>
<br>
Considering I never really had the use to use it for anything more than that, I never really dove into it beyond that.  But now I have a much better picture of the effect firing cycle, and learned about the cleanup method (new to me).

####Hello Node
<br>
<br>
A version of Hello, World has been written more than any other function, hands down.  Well, in web development, setting up your first server.js with express, cors, bodyparser and path has to be the next step equivalent.  In the master project of the course, we're adding a simple backend to be able to integrate Stripe's API, so we're back to basics with Node.  I am glad to do it, though, because given I don't really <em>need</em> a backend in many of my projects, I only practice it when I do.
<br>
<br>
I think I'll be able to comment on it in a more sophisticated manor once I've finished, and done more code with it, but it makes me wonder why Sagas, rather than other types of handles, thunk, etc.  The instructor has said multiple times the benefit of this section is really for 'if you're in a project/environment' that uses it, which tends to make me think it's a little outdated, but maybe I'm just not grasping it's full use case yet. 
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
Just keep going, and don't be afraid to practice things that you 'know'.  Refactoring even for just educational purposes (or especially) is key.
