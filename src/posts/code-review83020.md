I continued some basic work on future featuers today, but I also reviewed a small PR from our team lead, and it made me want to write today's blog about code review.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
Our team lead has often complimented me on my PRs.  Underneath the unordered list of commits from that branch, I write out what the new feature should do, any specific input I'm looking for on implementation, the testing I've done and the testing I'm requesting the people on the PR to do.
<br>
<br>
I know that I would appreciate that when I'm reviewing other team member's code.  I think it's so easy to forget how foreign the work you're doing can seem when the perspective is someone jumping in from square one.  What did that small change you do in a seemingly unrelated file do?  Why not just write it, instead of having me backtrack through the files to figure that out?
<br>
<br>
I'd like to think I'm also systematic in my testing.  He marked me as a reviewer, and I went through from beginning to end his code.  Starting at the shallowest level -- syntax errors, does this make sense, etc -- then trying to look for breaking logic.
<br>
<br>
That brings up another interesting concept I've been thinking about lately -- reviewing your own code.  I'm sure there are many ways to go about it.  For me, I worked on some fairly heavy duty mechanics this week.  While testing, I started at the granular, and went step by step, through the entire process.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
More reviews are always a good thing.  I wish we had a larger team, because I'd love if part of our nightly duties were looking at each other's sprints.  I think fresh eyes would do absolute wonders, and it'd be good to know that if I'm at a sticking point, we had scheduled points where I could go and bounce ideas off someone -- especially in the midst of it, instead of having to offered up finished work.
