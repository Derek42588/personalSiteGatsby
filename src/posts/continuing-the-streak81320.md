Moving day was today, and boy am I glad that it's (mostly) over.  Today's work was just the first part, and my girlfriend and I will have another, smaller trip to make at the end of the month, but this morning we packed up most of our belongings, including the heavier items, and I drove them to down to NJ where we'll be staying for a few months.  Of course, I'll have to unpack them all tomorrow...

####The Work
<br>
<br>
It might not have been much, but I was determined to keep my streak of this blog and learning something programming related every day.  As you could imagine, I didn't have a lot of energy tonight to dive into intense work, but I completed two leetcode challenges.
<br>
<br>
I've been feeling bad lately that after beginning with TypeScript, I've neglected writing in it.  When I get to work on leetcode/coding challenges, I've been trying to use only TS while doing so.
<br>
<br>
As of right now, I'm just working through the lists of problems, from easy to hard.  While on the easier ones, there's really not much use or benefit to using TS, but I'm hoping that repetition will pay off, and that when switching to the advanced ones later on, the foundation will be worth it.
<br>
<br>


####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
I completed the two exercises quicker than usual, and feel pretty good about my solutions.  I have been feeling, lately, that my solutions are a little too simplistic.  I've been trying to work in more advanced techniques when possible, but I'm a little stumped sometimes as to how to do that.
<br>
<br>
I've been wondering how I could improve on this.  I downloaded a recommended book on Algorithms, and I have a few udemy courses on leetcode/interview question exercises.  Hopefully, that will help.
