I decided to have another light day today.  We're still not getting much feedback from UX as to any crashing and breaking bugs, and to be honest, I know that once we release this week and start trying to build a userbase, things will get crazy.  So, no feature work for me today.

####The Work
<br>
<br>
I worked on some more leetcode exercises today.  I'd give myself a B- for the day.  There was a problem that I simply skipped because I couldn't get my head around the wording of the exercise.  I don't plan to skip it completely, but I wanted to actually get work in, not have my brain bleed trying to decipher their syntax choices.
<br>
<br>
That is a weakness of mine.  While trying to study algorithm and data structure books, I often find my eyes glazing over when they talk of Nk_1 ... Nk_199494, blah blah.  I wasn't a math savant, but I definitely wasn't a slouch.  I think I need to figure out a way how to easily translate things like that in my head when I read them.
<br>
<br>
For the problems I did do, I was pretty happy with what I came up with.  First, I was able to remember a shortcut that I came across while doing a <em>different</em> problem, and as such, breezed through it.
<br>
<br>
Now, that brings up an interesting question.  Is it 'cheating' to be using JS methods during these challenges?  Should I only be using primitive types?  Maybe.  But I also find value in reinforcing nice shortcuts that I know I can apply in real situations.
<br>
<br>
Another problem was trivially easy.  It was almost too easy, but hey, when you know something, don't look a gift horse.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
I've read many stories about how programmers are sometimes shocked by the simplicity of the problems given to them at a coding interview.  Like, actually be asked to do 'FizzBuzz', and so on.  I wonder if the second problem I described above was an example of that.
