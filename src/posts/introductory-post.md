Like many self taught developers before me, I'm going to attempt to write a blog detailing my journey.  I'd hope it could help someone else who stumbles onto my portfolio and blog, trying to reach the same goal that I am -- gaining a junior developer job without a degree.  This blog has two main goals: to detail the resources I've used to teach myself, and to force myself to post each day about at least one new thing I've learned. 
<br>
<br>
To start, a little bit of background.  While I've only had minimal formal training in anything CS related, I've definitely been on and around computers and the internet for practically my whole life.  I was on the internet back when it was mostly message boards and IRC was the geek "social media" platform of the day.  I guess the most apt description would be somewhere between enthusiast and power-user.  I love technology, and I explore it every chance I get.
<br>
<br>
As far as training, I've self-taught myself many different iterations of the most basic "web development" through the years.  I've probably made a dozen different personal websites -- geocities a few decades ago, a few different attempts at wordpress sites, a sports/humor blog I wrote for about a year and so on.  None of these explorations went much beyond relearning basic HTML/CSS each time or installing maybe a plugin or two.
<br>
<br>
Next, I took a semester's worth of Intro to CS classes at my local community college.  Basic CS, intro to SQL, and basic Java programming. I enjoyed it immensely, and definitely think formal training is the way to go if that is an option.  Unfortunately, I was offered a different job that took away the time I'd have to continue, and stopped at these few classes.
<br>
<br>
Finally, for what I'd consider my "training" before I decided to learn seriously with the eventual goal of switching my career, I completed the excellent University of Helsinki's Massive Open Online Course on Java about 7 years ago.  Here I learned the basics of object oriented programming, for loops, functions, and so on.  My first "hello world" was definitely done in Java and with this course. While I think there are better resources for someone who's trying to learn full time, I still think this is a perfect choice for someone who wants to try it out and see if programming is for them before exploring other options.
<br>
<br>
About 18 months ago, around January of 2019, I decided to truly dedicate myself to transitioning to a development career.  At the advice of some friends who are in the field, they recommended learning web development, and so I started.
<br>
<br>
Back then, I would have said I hated learning via video course.  I couldn't say exactly what it was that didn't appeal to me, but looking back it was probably simply that I had never done it before and was used to formal, classroom learning.  Now I would recommend it to anyone, especially with the myriad courses out there.  Primarily, I've done courses through Udemy, but also tried Lynda, edX, coursera, and privately published ones.  If you want to learn it, there are multiple courses out there.
<br>
<br>
Before I transition to writing posts about new concepts I'm learning now, I'm going to try and get this blog up to date with how I've gotten to the point I'm at now -- from January 2019 where I was starting out, able to write a for loop and computer literate but barely more -- to now, June 2020 where I am hopeful I am either nearly ready or already ready to be hired as a Junior developer.  My next post will go over the beginning of my self-teaching -- the courses, concepts, what I struggled with and what I learned.
