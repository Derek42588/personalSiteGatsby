Somewhat reluctantly, I began working more with PHP, as a freelance client required it.  It was old, legacy set up -- via Codeigniter -- and used Bootstrap as the CSS.  While I didn't love it at first, I'm really getting into it now.  Especially with my new best friend, Laravel.  Mostly, I'm just glad to add more tools to my belt and resume.
<br>
<br>

####Initial Thoughts
<br>
<br>
For one, I had always kind of stayed away from Bootstrap. I was kind of a snob about it to be honest -- just write your own CSS, right? Since this freelance project leveraging was fairly large, I didn't want to completely write the CSS until a later date.
<br>
<br>
Now I'm looking at it in a bit more of a favorable light. For one, and this should have been obvious to me, it doesn't have to be all or nothing. I can hook in Bootstrap, and use the classes I want, and my own for the rest -- as well as overwriting Bootstrap classes and variables, etc.
<br>
<br>
Another thing I'm coming to appreciate are the helper classes -- grid, flex, margin, and padding baked right in for you. Finally, it's so widely used that it almost looks and feels like 'best practices' to use those classes.
<br>
<br>
As for Laravel, I had a friend describe it as React for PHP and I can definitely see where he's coming from. The various artisan commands, the out of the box SASS support, and so much more -- I'm really enjoying it.
<br>
<br>
If you would have asked me before, I would have said I wouldn't bother with any other front end frameworks, since I could already achieve everything I needed perfectly well with the stack I was already using. Now, though, I really appreciate what Laravel offers -- and I haven't even checked out its Vue and React support.

####What's Next
<br>
<br>
With Laravel and PHP, I'm making my girlfriend a resume site, and after that, a website for a family member's landscaping business.
