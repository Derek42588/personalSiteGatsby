For lack of anything else specific to work on, I dove back into the below named course.  I had been about 20% through it when I switched to first work on my own firebase authentication boilerplate, and then my firebase game project.  I enjoyed it up to the point I had completed and think the instructor is good, but I didn't want to do the same old code-along project for the millionth time.

####Andrei Neagoie - Complete React Developer in 2020 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)
<br>
<br>
For lack of anything else specific to work on, I dove back into the above named course.  I had beena bout 20% through it when I switched to first work on my own firebase authentication boilerplate, and then my firebase game project.  I enjoyed it up to the point I had completed and think the instructor is good, but I didn't want to do the same old code-along project for the millionth time.
<br>
<br>
Now that I'm revisiting, I'm feeling more inspired to complete the course.  While I do know all of the topics broadly, from the firebase and redux concepts alone, after my game project I am feeling <em>much</em> more confident with them, and I feel like I'm absorbing more of the content rather than just coding along.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
Today, I can't think of anything concrete to write here.  I think I'm just feeling like a lot more concepts are clicking for me.  Things are coming a little easier, and are a little clearer in my mind.  
<br>
<br>
I learned that can be a good thing too, and not just expect a breakthrough every day.
<br>
<br>
I remembered to not let myself get discouraged.  Even though I'm not getting call backs yet on the many, many, many applications I'm sending out, it will come in time.  I love coding.  I love this work.  It makes sense to me, it's fun, it's enjoyable.  That will come through to an employer eventually.
