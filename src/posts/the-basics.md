####March 2019 - June 2019
<br>
<br>
Picking up from the last <a href = "/posts/first-forays/">post</a>, I was now finished with my first online course in React, but a little stumped as to where to go next or how to apply anything I had just learned.  I had decided that I really needed to dive deeper into JavaScript, HTML and CSS, as the minimal knowledge I had of all those prior to beginning my self-study weren't really sufficient to start applying to bigger, more real-world level projects.  
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I didn't keep a journal of my step-by-step back then, so I'm going from memory and the timeline might be slightly off.  I do know that what I worked on at or around this time were Colt Steele's <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a> and Maximilian Schwarzmuller's <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/">CSS - The Complete Guide</a>
<br>
<br>

####Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp
<br>
<br>
I would definitely recommend this course to anyone trying to follow the same path I am - from nothing to full stack web developer.  Steele is a good teacher, the projects are meaningful and have a lot of great components to come back and reference, and despite covering a wide range of topics, it's comprehensive (46.5 hours of content)
<br>
<br>
This was my first foray into REST APIs, express, node, and more.  While it would take a while (and a lot of more projects) for those concepts to click, it was definitely critical to my understanding of what skills I would need to learn as a developer.
<br>
<br>
Further, I think a comprehensive course on these topics are absolutely necessary to start with, but understanding JavaScript/Node/Express are definitely way more important than HTML/CSS.  If you can find another course that focuses more on those aspects for that part of your development, I would recommend that, but otherwise I don't think you can really go wrong by using this as a starting off point.
<br>
<br>

####Maximilian Schwarzmuller's CSS - The Complete Guide
<br>
<br>
One thing I remember frustrating me a lot at this point was the CSS aspect of development.  To be honest, I think it's just been a conitnual frustration (and I enjoy writing it more and more now, but there are definitely still moments where it drives me crazy).  Many, many of the courses I've taken and would also recommend will just kind of gloss over CSS -- as they should, if its not a course focusing on it.  However, this kind of leads you to a point where you're just staring at a wall.  Ugly, ugly components, where when you're starting out, if you try to apply any CSS changes, you can break a million things about your design/layout and not know where you went wrong.
<br>
<br>
This course was fine, and I've enjoyed others of Schwarzmuller's.  However, I mostly just skimmed through it when I was trying to reference specific concepts I wanted to learn (flexbox, grid, specific components).  Personally, for the CSS aspects of your career, I'd recommend Jonas Schmedtmann's <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass">Advanced CSS and Sass</a> over anything else.   I'll go over it more fully in a future blog post, as I've taken this course more recently, but taking Schmedtmann's Sass course was the point for me when styling and CSS finally started to click.

####It's A Long, Long Road
<br>
<br>
Writing this post and going over some past projects and courses, something I just keep noticing is just how key repitition and practice were for me in developing my skills.  People always tell you when you're learning that creating your own projects are by far the way you learn the most, and that's true.  What I think might get lost in translation is what you should expect out of yourself from these projects.
<br>
<br>
I've made personal portfolio sites at least four different times, each after learning a new concept and wanting to apply it.  I'm pretty confident that this current iteration (Gatsby, React, Sass) will stick around for the long haul, but who knows?  Maybe I'll learn Vue and decide I need to start from scratch again.
<br>
<br>
You probably don't feel like you're accomplishing much when you make the same form, the same basic structure of React note-taking app that saves to mongodb and uses your basic boilerplate express REST api, etc.  But for me at least, I just needed to keep doing them and doing them.
