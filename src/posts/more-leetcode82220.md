For today, I couldn't really summon the motivation to do any work on the mobile app.  Honestly, I've been a little exhausted working on the bug fixes.  There are future things I could work on, and I plan to get back to it tomorrow.  But for today, I needed some lighter work.

####The Work
<br>
<br>
So, to get in my daily coding, I did some more leetcode challenges.  I think I did alright.  
<br>
<br>
Sometimes I had to look at the solutions.  Sometimes I had to work backwards from prompts.  I still can't think of a different way to get better at these than to do pretty much that.
<br>
<br>
One solution in particular was for a problem that I solved on my local, but failed on evaluation because it didn't pass runtime.  So, after peeking a different solution, I realized some things I hadn't considered doing, and definitely feel like I can improve there after seeing it.
<br>
<br>
But what I'm scratching my head over is some of the logic afterwards.  I can't, for the life of me, figure out how someone would naturally arrive to it.  It can't possibly come from whiteboarding.
<br>
<br>
The only thing I can think of is that after arriving at the generals, he worked back through the particulars to make them as concise, fast, and memory-aware as possible.  Good practice, of course.  Still, though, there's a missing step there.  I got to keep trying to figure out how to find that step.
