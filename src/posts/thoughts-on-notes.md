Unfortunately, did not get to do any practical programming done today.  We unfortunately found out that our apartment's bed bug infestation has <em>not</em> been taken care of, and as such, had to spend my time today taking care of errands around the house to prepare for another round of extermination.
<br>
<br>
I'm going to try to get some practical programming done later in the evening after we finish some more chores.  For today's post, though, I didn't want to stretch it out or try to write about anything I wasn't actually able to get to today.  
<br>
<br>
I figured I'd write about something else I've thought about a bit lately, which is how I take notes.
<br>
<br>

####Best Practice?
<br>
<br>
I try to take a lot of notes -- or at least, I do now.  I wasn't always so thorough when I was first starting to learn.  
<br>
<br>
My main platform for notes is Evernote.  I take a video course, I write what I find noteworthy in a singular (long) note, named for the course I'm taking at the time.  I never go back to organize them -- they're searchable, and I figure that works for my purposes. 
<br>
<br>
I do wonder if there's a better system I could be using.  
<br>
<br>
By a very large margin, the one note I've actually gone back and referred to multiple times is the one I made for boilerplate setup -- something that I was having a hard time with.  I went through and noted down how to set up an app, from beginning to production, and noted <em>everything</em> I needed to do for my usual stack.  It was incredibly helpful.
<br>
<br>
I don't know what else I could apply that to.  For example, my new application, needing a different setup for Prisma, a Postgres DB, and GraphQL takes a different setup -- but that's all in my notes for that course.  
<br>
<br>
I'd like more applied study time, as well.  I've had many thoughts lately that I should be doing more -- more specifically, I spend aobut 8-6ish doing live coding, but for the rest of my day, I've been thinking a little bit more passive learning could be squeezed in.  
<br>
<br>
On those lines, I've been trying to go through more programming books in my off time -- I've got one on prepping for programming issues, the first book of the You Don't Know JS Yet series, and a book on best Git practices.  I've enjoyed them all, but it's hard to really have concepts stick when you're not actively programming.
<br>
<br>
In addition to evernote notes, I've also been trying to take down notecards to quiz myself in downtime (Anki Notes for android).  I think that would be a good idea, but I don't have a good handle on what exactly to be putting on notecards yet.  Especially when these are expansive ideas, it's hard to encapsulate in a notecard like that.  Maybe I should try to narrow down the best way of simplifying it.  Go very broad and simple?  What's a hook, what's a lifecycle method, etc?
<br>
<br>
I've also thought that a deep dive into documentation would be a good activity during these times.  I don't know, though.  Times like these, I feel like it would be really good to have a mentor to give me advice and guide me to the right course.  But, when all you can do is muddle through, you just got to keep muddling.
