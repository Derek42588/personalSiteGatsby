I have to be honest, I did need a bit of a break today.  I've been coding 8+ hours 7 days a week for... well, a while.  So today, while I did do a little bit of work and studying, I'm mostly going to relax.
<br>
<br>
But I didn't do nothing, at least.  The whole point of this blog is to code every day, so no matter what, I want to improve each and every day, even if it's in a small way.
<br>
<br>

####What's Next
<br>
<br>
I think I'll take at least a few days before starting any new projects.  For one, I don't have any specific ideas besides adding different games to my new game app, and I think for prospective employers it's probably better to have a larger portfolio rather than going back and reworking an app that is already done and workable.
<br>
<br>
I might change my mind on that, but for the next day or so, I'll just focus on studying concepts and going back to some Udemy courses I've been working on.
<br>
<br>
I am excited to say that when I reopened a course on Redux, React, and Firebase, I feel way more confident in my understanding after having done my game app!  Where as I had some code-along code I feel like I sort of knew, but not exactly, I'm definitely understanding the ins and outs more.
<br>
<br>
Some specifics I'll be trying to go over more is making sure I understand Promises and async/await (fairly confident, but can always improve my application of the ideas).  More to come tomorrow.
