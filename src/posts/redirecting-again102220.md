The startup I have been working for reached the first "official" pitch meeting, highly anticipated for months.  While they didn't fail, they also did not secure investments, but got some feedback and a request to come back in a month.
<br>
<br>
I spoke extensively with the CTO and CEO after this meeting, and they were in high spirits, already planning to pivot in their goals and add different revenue streams.  I hope they do well, and hope to return to the company full time.  However, for now, I need to try and secure something different in the mean time, while they reassess.

####Job Hunting Again
<br>
<br>
By far my least favorite thing to do, I'm back to job hunting.  For now, I'll be applying all over.  Remote, in person (my partner and I will relocate), anything.  I am hoping that this current experience secures me some more interviews, but I am worried.  I have still been applying even while working at this position, just at a smaller volume than I was when I was applying full-time, and I haven't noticed my recent experience opening any more doors.
<br>
<br>
I will also be trying to bid for more freelance work on places like Upwork and Fiverr, etc.
<br>
<br>
I think I'd like to spend some more time focusing on front end for a while.  I've been enjoying learning PHP for the freelance client I mentioned in my last blog post.  Also, the CTO at the startup company I had been working for made 4k-6k a month working very part time, completely via freelance projects.  PHP was the entirety of his work, too.
<br>
<br>

####Misc.
<br>
<br>
I met and networked with a lot of great people on this startup project, chief among them my friend from the development team.  He, too, will be moving on from the project.  He's a bootcamp grad, but will be taking advantage of scholarship opportunities to get his CS degree as well, and will be applying to positions too.  We've decided to meet up twice a week for coding challenges to keep ourselves accountable, and today will be the first of such meetings.
