Hectic, hectic day.  My girlfriend and I finalized our move, and this week is also our... well, I guess 'soft launch' is the best term for it.

####The Work
<br>
<br>
I was fairly confident when I dove into our environment this morning, but that quickly devolved once I realized we'd be dealing with heavy duty triage this week.
<br>
<br>
The biggest challenge this week is that our UX team is going to be testing errors on our new build, and reporting those (which, by the way, we had a bad master merge so they're already numerous errors I know we're going to get there).
<br>
<br>
On TOP of that, though, the biz dev and other outreach teams are pushing for live users on our launched app.  So will also have to be trying to bug catch in THAT build as well.
<br>
<br>
To be honest, most of the issues on the live we've gotten so far are user error.  How do you say that politely though?
