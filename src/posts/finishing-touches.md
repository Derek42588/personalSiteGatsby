I have to be honest with you, I really didn't feel like I was progressing much this past month or so.  I took a few new courses, I expanded my knowledge a little bit, and I polished projects that I had already completed.  But as far as new material, I wasn't doing much.
<br>
<br>
I <em>am</em> incredibly glad I finished the firebase auth boilerplate.  I am a total boilerplate junkie now.  But beyond that, I was going through courses, about to make the fiftieth variation of the same sort of app I've done a million times before, and feeling like I needed to make a <em>real</em> project to keep making more progress, and to hopefully impress a prospective employer.
<br>
<br>
I blanked, though.  I couldn't think of anything I wanted to or even felt I could do at that point that wasn't just a rehash.

####Finishing Up the Game App
<br>
<br>
I've outlined the difficulties I've had with my current game project throughout the previous recent posts of this blog, but it's really coming together now.  I hope to finish it tonight or tomorrow morning!
<br>
<br>
I won't say its the most impressive thing in the world, but it's not nothing, either.  I've got some extensive game logic in it, a fully tested, live-updating multiplayer game-flow, all synched through the Firebase Realtime Database.
<br>
<br>
Not only that, but a few features I thought wouldn't be implemented until at least version 2 I was able to finish today!  The somewhat daunting concepts of an autoupdating, auto-scrolling chat box and a live timer for my game logic were implemented far easier than I anticipated.  Of course, I had help from StackOverflow for the chat box and from the npm package react-countdown.  But even that makes me feel pretty good, because applying StackOverflow answers and implementing via the github documentation of the react-countdown package boosts my confidence a bit.  
<br>
<br>
Additionally, I feel like I figured out a pretty neat (if superficial) feature: the chat box username's are all different colors and live-updating.  I do have to admit I was struggling with it and being an idiot, passing some props down to acheive it, before I realized I set up redux for a reason, and the data I needed to implement it would be in my store.  But that will come with practice, practice, practice.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
I'm sure the next downturn will come soon.  I'll hit a wall again (and, of course, I'm just ignoring the fact that I haven't gotten any callbacks for interviews yet).  But I feel like I can be proud of this accomplishment.  Who knows what final brick will be the turning point in me being able to get a job, but this will definitely be part of the foundation.
<br>
<br>
I learned I need to refactor early, or I wont at all.  My main game component is a behemoth and could use with editing -- but at this point, I need to do that after I finish v1.
<br>
<br>
I gained some more experience with flex-box.  Of course, I've used it extensively before, but I've always felt more comfortable with grid, even with one dimensional elements.  But I forced myself to use flex where appropriate, and it came out fine.  I'm confident I'll feel as comfortable with flex as I do with grid soon enough.
<br>
<br>
I'm excited to share this code and project.  I'm sure I'll have it done by Sunday afternoon at the latest (it's 95% done as is)...barring any major bugs that I missed, but I'll have to worry about that when it happens.
