I continued working on the Firebase Authentication boilerplate I wrote about in <a href = "/posts/firebase-auth-1/">this post</a>, and am very excited.  It's very robust, but more time consuming than I had expected.  If nothing else, it's really driling into me to just keep making more and more boilerplate repos that I can quickly use in the future.
<br>
<br>
I'll continue to work on that and post a more in depth walkthrough of all of it when I finish it either tomorrow or the next day.  For today's post, I'll go into a few other subjects that I worked on throughout the day.
<br>
<br>

####Linked In, Job Hunting and More
<br>
<br>
Like probably everyone everywhere, I hate applying for jobs.  I absolutely hate the loop some applications send you through.  First you're clicking on a google job alert, then "Apply On [JobSearchSite]" which redirects you to X, which redirects you to Y, which redirects you to...
<br>
<br>
Which says nothing of applications that have you upload your resume, automatically parses it (incorrectly), and then has you go back and re-input everything. 
<br>
<br>
I had been neglecting updating my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-pyle-21572a8b/">LinkedIn</a>, probably out of stubborness.  I think it's a pretty silly platform, and I would hope that a tech sector wouldn't put too much stock in an (in my opinion) outdated social media network.  But, might as well be thorough, no? 
<br>
<br>
I had seen LinkedIn mention their skill quizzes before, but had put off completing them until now.  I figure that while I'm still building my portfolio and waiting to land my first full-time position, it's as good a thing as any to display at least some working knowledge.  I completed the React.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Python, and OOP quizzes today.  They're all 15 questions, and to be honest, a pretty good test of knowledge.  
<br>
<br>

####Daily Routine
<br>
<br>
To give an idea of my current routine (outside of actually coding), I spend about an hour each morning searching for and applying for jobs.  I use the typical sites -- CareerBuilder, Stack Overflow Jobs, Google Jobs, etc -- as well as a few that are specific to Boston.
<br>
<br>
Beyond that, I've decided to add another half hour or so of looking for volunteer/networking oppportunities.  Unfortunately, due to COVID all networking is done via Zoom meetings, but that has its advantages.  I can just find something, log in and watch/listen while still working in the background.
<br>
<br>
Today, I attended a webinar on Kubernetes done by CockroachDB.  To be honest, I would have no use for Kubernetes with what I do so far, but I do know that it's in use a lot of workplaces and looking more into that and Docker is definitely on my to-do.
<br>
<br>

####Cache Problems, Continued.
<br>
<br>
In <a href = "/posts/miscellaneous-wednesday/">yesterday's post</a>, I described some caching issues I was having with this blog on my site hosted on SiteGround.  I encountered more issues that I worked on today, but will outline them in an updated version of yesterday's post, so that anyone who has the same issue and happens to stumble on my post by googling would have a full answer.
