####More Game Logic
<br>
<br>
Today, most of my coding work was just fleshing out more of the game logic of my new game project.  I really enjoyed working out functions one at a time, and feel like it was an effective way to work.
<br>
<br>
What's more, I figured out more of what in my app would need to be in the Firebase Realtime DB rather than the redux store.  I wonder how people figure this out before actually starting to write the code?  I imagine some of it is by trial and error, and then eventually you just instinctively know what needs to go where.
<br>
<br>
For the immediate future, though, I do know I'll need to write this way.  It will force me to take things slowly and step by step, and not get lost in the weeds.

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
You just <em>have</em> to write dummy code and get the small bits working before moving onto the bigger ones.  Writing pseudocode with pena dn paper was good for identifying the broad strokes, but before actually seeing the codes and functions working in action and in conjunction, you just don't know what you need until you do it.
<br>
<br>
I learned I need to spend some more time learning listeners on Firebase.  What exactly is coming back and being watched on its snapshots, etc... I get sort of get it but I also sort of don't. 
<br>
<br>
I learned, or rather reaffirmed, to just keep going even when I'm getting stumped or not making too much progress.  It might be a good idea to have two separate "chunks" to work on at the same time.  When you're not making much progress on one chunk, just let it go and work on the other.  You'll be getting work done, and when you switch back, you might see things more clearly or have things click.
<br>
<br>

####Random Thoughts
<br>
<br>
I think I'd like to also start another side project, one of two ideas: my girlfriend's been getting rid of a good amount of her junk, and I think I could make her a nice site for all of it.  Secondarily, a friend has a hair-styling business and could use a new website for that.  Might be a good application of having two things to work on at once, something to switch back and forth between when I'm hitting walls.
<br>
<br>
I really, really love JavaScript and React.  Just wanted to write that.
