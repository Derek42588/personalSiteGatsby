I've been doing well, working on the few freelance projects I currently have open.  In addition to those, I've been doing a very heavy focus on applying (as always, in and of itself a full time job) and working on the algorithm and interview question focused <a href = "algoexpert.io">AlgoExpert.io</a>
<br>
<br>
As far as the applying goes... I've had one or two step one conversations that I felt went well, and am hoping to hear more from.  Besides those, just a whole lot of nothing.  It's really tough out there.  I see all these posts on reddit's /r/DataIsBeautiful about applications, graphs where people follow the same basic model of showing total applications, responses, second interviews, offers, etc.  I feel like I'll be hitting 1k on the total applications fairly soon, and I could count the number of serious responses on one hand.

As I've mentioned before, the AlgoExpert site is excellent. I haven't even dived into the instructional videos yet, just the problems themselves, of which I've done about 1/3. There are quite a few in that number I'd like to revisit to get a more solid understanding of, but I don't want to 'stall out' for too long on any given one. Hopefully, by expanding my overall understanding, I can keep learning techniques and then can revisit ones that I've stumbled on and apply them.
<br>
<br>
I'm trying to be more aware of my shortcomings in approaching problems, and then trying to improve. One area that needs improvement is definitely recognizing edge cases. I believe I mentioned that before, but I continue to have problems with it.
<br>
<br>
Another is trying to do too much at once. I definitely feel like I've improved in utilizing my own helper functions, which just add so much to your code's overall readability. Beyond that, though, I think I need to do better at boiling down the problem at hand to one element at a time. What needs to happen first? Then? And so on.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes, I'll watch AlgoExpert's video walkthrough -- the concept explanation, rather than the code walkthrough. It's so amazing how, once the underlying concept clicks, the code itself is almost trivial.
<br>
<br>
The only time I've ever looked at code that would align with their 'official' solutions and thought it was convoluted was when it was necessarily so -- tricky methods on tree nodes, or similar.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise, it's often 50% as many lines as my initial attempt. The logic is elegant. Once the veil drops, its such an 'aha!' moment.
<br>
<br>
I really hope I can continue to get better with these. I do feel proud of a number of my solutions -- but that number can and should keep getting bigger and bigger.
<br>
<br>
I do worry that I'm focusing too much on this, rather than working on additional projects for my portfolio. It's definitely a worthwhile venture, though. I will only get better as a programmer by continuing to progress with it. As I've thought a hundred times before -- if only I never had to sleep at all, then I could do everything I wanted to do, all at once, and then some.
