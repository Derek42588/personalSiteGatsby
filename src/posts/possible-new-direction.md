<br>
Wow, a lot changed today.  I am unsure if it will definitely be the direction I take, but I tentatively accepted an (unpaid) development internship.<br>
<br>
The main project I was brought on for is primarily React Native.  Funnily enough, I had started a course on React Nactive this morning, after having finished the TypeScript one I had described in my most recent posts.
<br>
<br>
The person who onboarded me was confident that I could contribute and get up to speed in other areas of the project, without having to know React Native, but I am definitely planning on learning that as well, hopefully squeezing it in when I have spare time.  I won't get into the specifics of the company, but will instead try to give my generalized impressions and talk about the work I'll do in a non-descriptive way.
<br>
<br>

####Initial Thoughts
<br>
<br>
It's definitely intimidating, being added to a team and inundated with information. My day was mostly spent in zoom meetings (dev and wider scope), being added to Trello boards and Slack channels, and trying to dig my way through the project code.
<br>
<br>
I was even assigned my first tasks during the dev team zoom meeting. I'm trying to not let my anxiety get ahead of me. It has to do with firebase, which I definitely spent a lot of time on while making my live game app. It even deals with those direct issues -- presenting the data in a live manor.
<br>
<br>
The intimidation factor comes in in the fact that this is my first time contributing to a project, one with an architecture I had no hand in, dealing with data that I didn't structure myself, trying to possibly apply my own learned fixes to a situation that it might not even apply to.
<br>
<br>
Not only that, I have no idea how to properly test this app, or my attempted fixes at it, in React Native form.  
<br>
<br>
But -- I made the first steps in trying to set up a dev tool environment, and I think that will help. My basic plan of attack as it stands is to first wire up those dev tools, make sure they're working, and then do like I've always done -- code until something sticks to the wall.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
Dev scrums are more or less what I assumed they'd be. Assigning tasks, talking about goals, talking about possible fixes, and so on.
<br>
<br>
It was a little alarming to see the goals that were set. There is a LOT of work that is expected by next week or so (not assigned to me), and looking at the manpower they have, it seems like they'll be hardpressed to accomplish it.
<br>
<br>
But, there's nothing I can do but try. I might be intimidated, and this might not be the exact perfect environment I had hoped for, that would teach me while also engaging my skills I already had, but you do your best with what's in front of you.
