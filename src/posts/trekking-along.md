It's been a while since my last post!  Honestly, I've been so busy that I've just been focusing on the work I'm doing for the startup company, where I've taken on more and more responsibility.  Additionally, I've started to work in PHP as a freelancer for a client of a friend I was referred to.  It's only a very small amount of hours per week, but once that first paycheck comes through, it's going to feel pretty great.

####The Work
<br>
<br>
To give an overview of what's been going on, I've taken over an ever growing role at the startup company I've been working at.  I'm still coding as much as before, but I'm now also doing more project management type tasks.  I spend quite a lot of time with our more junior devs helping them with their sprints, interviewing new prospects, teaching in our workships and other management type activities.
<br>
<br>
As far as the coding for that project goes, I feel as if I'm getting more comfortable with React Native.  A few of the interesting features I've worked on are integrating a 3rd party library for video chat within our app and redesigning our signup flow.
<br>
<br>
Next, diving into this PHP project has been fun.  First, it's very nice experience.  Next, it's taking over an already created project, which I feel is a spot devs often find themselves in.  Lastly, it uses Bootstrap for its CSS, which I'm familiar with, but have never used in a larger scaled project like this one.
<br>
<br>
Getting used to that, doing copy edits for a contracting client, and estimating time necessities for future features are all good experience for me.
<br>
<br>

####Up Next
<br>
<br>
The startup I'm at will be pitching for some initial funding on Monday.  It's make or break time.  I'm excited -- I've poured a lot of time and energy into this project.  Even if we don't get funding, though, I'm glad to be turning the page, one way or the other.
