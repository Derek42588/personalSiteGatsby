<br>
We had our second weekly dev meeting today, and went over what our next sprints would be.  We're at a weird time with the company.  To be honest, I had hoped after getting into the app store, we would stop working on features for a while.
<br>
<br>
There are many, many maintainence things we can be pivoting towards.  Getting a full backup flow, getting our e2es up and running, validating DB data, and smoothing out every single bug on this release -- this is the time to be doing that.  Once we switch to having live users, we're going to have <em>so</em> many bugs and feature requests that we never could have anticipated that we'll be working on nothing but that.  Now that we have an MVP, we should be taking the time we have left to smooth out these issues.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand though, we are still missing some key functionality.  Everything works, but just speaking as a hypothetical user, there are definitely facets that don't work as I would expect them to or are missing.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
I did some coding interview testing questions in the morning, and some miscellaneous testing on our app.  After that, we started our company wide zoom meeting in the afternoon, and then transitioned to the dev team meeting, and both of them took about 6 hours total.
<br>
<br>
The dev team meeting definitely had some friction.  I covered it above, but honestly, it really comes down to manpower.  There are about four of us who code and most are part time.  We're limited by that.
<br>
<br>
I was happy to say that as we did some group coding, I was able to figure out two of the main issues.  It's slower, but I do really enjoy coding collaboratively that way.
<br>
<br>
Now, it's already the evening, but I'd like to start on my sprint. I hope to get it done quickly and then work on some of our backlog afterwards.
