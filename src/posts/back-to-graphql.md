As I'm waiting to hear back from my friend's wife on what she'd like her site to contain, I spent most of my day back studying, rather than the mini-project I have mentioned in the previews few days' posts.  Today, I began by completing a few more sections of the Modern React course I have mentioned in my recent posts.  At this point in the course, the main portions are now completed, and the instructors have moved on to 'bonus' material.  I may go back shortly and finish (I will finish at some point, because I thought it was a great course), but I'd like to move on to more in depth topics.  I began <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-bootcamp/">The Modern GraphQL Bootcamp (with Node.js and Apollo)</a> by Andrew Mead on Udemy.
<br>
<br>
I have already taken a GraphQL course, and even integrated it into some of my own personal projects.  Now, however, it is my hope that since I understand my stack more, I will be able to integrate it in a more elegant and thorough way.  I am hoping it's not too beginner-focused, but even if so, I think a review of GraphQL is in order for me.  It's been months since I've truly written it, in both back and front end.
<br>
<br>
I'd like to get a few things out of it.  First, given that this course seems to be focused on the backend aspects of GraphQL (and I've just now spent more time on only the front end part of it), a more thorough understanding of that backend setup, and more specifically, a good base boilerplate to work off of.
<br>
<br>
Next, subscriptions and asynchronous, live data.  If, like my Modern React course suggests, GraphQL + Apollo is more of a <em>replacement</em> for Redux than a fetching tool (how I've used it in the past in my limited understanding of what it offered), how can I make my next project the classic MERN stack + GraphQL and Apollo for state management.

####ES6 Syntax in Node
<br>
<br>
Not very interesting, but it was cool that this was the first course to show me how to use ES6 syntax in Node.  I've never really had a need to do so, but pretty much every course I've had so far has used older import syntax, and some have even mentioned that "it would be coming soon".  I suppose it's here!

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
Most of the work I did today was just refamiliarizing with types, methods, and setup.  One new item to me was using graphql-yoga as the server, which I had not been familiar with yet.
<br>
<br>
I do think I already have a better understanding of the schema and resolvers than I had before.  I'm not sure if it's just a case of practice makes perfect -- I have a broader understanding, and so it feels less like coding-by-numbers and more like learning.  Either way, I hope I can use it effectively.
