I was thinking a lot today about the dynamics of coding within a team, reporting to both a team leader and others within the company who have input, and the structure of what I've found to be a typical work cycle while working for this startup.
<br>
<br>
First off, I'd call my experience here positive overall.  I've gotten a <em>lot</em> of experience, I enjoy everyone I work with, and I like the project.  Still, I thought it would be valuable to try and imagine how I could improve our workflow process, were I the dev team lead, or a PM, etc.
<br>
<br>
It was easiest to start with my most common complaints.  Often, I find the expectations unreasonable.  Now, let me explain that, because I don't shy away from hard work.  I can be given a sprint task, one thats expected to be completed within ~3 days (I guess more of a half sprint), and that's alongside other tasks as well.
<br>
<br>
Well, what if that's something thats not really feasible at all with our tech stack?  Or, would require months of work?  Obviously, I can report that, and I do.  My team leader is very good with feedback, and doesn't have unreasonable expectations.
<br>
<br>
Could that be improved though?  Maybe, when assigning tasks for sprints, we have concrete tasks as in implement this feature we know we can add, work on this slice, fix these bugs.  In addition, we could have research tasks that aren't expected to be completed, but a report is meant to be given at the next meeting about feasibility, time to implement, difficulties, etc.
<br>
<br>
The next thing that came to mind is probably a very, very common complaint in the current workforce -- wasted time with zoom meetings.  That's definitely compounded by the type of startup we are -- constant, constant rotating of new team members.  That doesn't bother me, though, because it's a necessary task.  Someones new, you have to introduce them.
<br>
<br>
Often, though, we spend a lot of time watching people's screen casts as they literally type into a Trello card, say.  A more streamlined workflow here would be to simply take shorthand minutes of the meeting where we talk about the sprints, and then go back and add the trello cards, and so on.
<br>
<br>
Most importantly, I would absolutely 'hardcode' in planned times where no new features are being added.  Whatsoever.  I could spend this time only working on bugs, sanitizing the DB, teaching new team members, and so much more.  New features means new bugs.  Always, always, always.
