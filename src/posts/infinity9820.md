Got good work done today.  Mostly just miscellaneous testing and hotfixing, but I feel like that's gotta be the most common day-to-day.  Attended the UX meeting, in the hopes of smoothing that relationship.

####The Work
<br>
<br>
Tested our new build fairly thoroughly, and I think we're in okay shape.  We'll get into the stores no problem.  I worry that we haven't had enough testing done, but honestly, we got to get better about pre-identifying issues too.
<br>
<br>
Patched a few things and then worked on some wishlist stuff.
<br>
<br>
During the UX meeting, I definitely see some disconnect in what we can and cannot expect from each other.  Since they're not developers, by definition they don't have an understanding of what goes into creating some of the things they request.  Moreover, we've been getting so many different inputs that instantly become high priority -- potential partners, the CEO, real startups who give feedback -- that it's hard to maintain any semblance of a workflow.
<br>
<br>
I also think we just need to make some scheduling changes.  Maybe three to five people tested between yesterday and this afternoon.  Of course yesterday was the holiday, but still.  How are we supposed to be making good progress on UX issues if we're not doing the bulk of the testing until halfway through the sprint?

####Up Next
<br>
<br>
I can't remember if I mentioned it in this blog, but I've been wanting to do a bit of a coding challenge for a little while.  A friend of mine who is gainfully employed has mentioned a coding interview/challenge he got a few times, which was basically to create an app over a weekend, within a certain stack.
<br>
<br>
It was extra challenging for him, because he wasn't really familiar with some of the stack, wheras I've had an introduction.  I plan to balance out the challenge by trying to a little bit more fully functioned than the app he made (which is still very impressive given the constraints).
<br>
<br>
I'd like to refresh myself on a bit of the stack, but once I have, I'll give myself the same limitations.  Maybe I'll have to kind of "time" it into what equates to two days, since I often am working on the internship over the weekend.  I'll figure that part out as I go.
