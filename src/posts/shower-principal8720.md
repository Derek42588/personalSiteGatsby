Both last night and this morning, I spent time trying to implement a feature from my sprint.  I didn't make good progress, or rather, I just didn't like my implementation.  I was frustrated for most of the day, but I am very happy to say that I was able to get past it.
<br>
<br>
Some downtime spent discouraged, though.  We have so, so much to do.  Our UX team doesn't think we're ready to be client facing, and I see their point.  It's just a struggle when it feels like every critical step is the responsibility of the dev team, and there are just so few of us.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
There are often moments in coding where I get disgusted with myself when I struggle to implement something incredibly simple.  At least my standards have risen a little, so what I consider incredbily simple is probably infinitely more complex than what it would have been a few months ago.  
<br>
<br>
Basically, I'm implementing some autocompletion for some of our form fields, where you can either submit your own, or pick from a list.  I'm oversimplifying, but that's the gist. 
<br>
<br>
I think I'm more disappointed in my presentation more than anything else, but also that I had to fail for a bit before I remembered myself and got into gear.  Oh well, standard pitfalls.  
<br>
<br>
Thankfully, after a bit of head banging, I switched to my other sprint responsibility this week - bug fixing.  
<br>
<br>
Most were fairly simple.  We still have DB issues, but we have a DB team now working on that and I'm hopeful that that'll a thing of the past soon.  Purging pretty much anything before the real user-facing launch will be huge, too.
<br>
<br>
A few front end validations here, and a few DB checks there.
<br>
<br>
I feel like I cleared everything that was mission-critical fairly quickly.  Unfortunately, there were errors I simply couldn't reproduce.  For each, I made videos of myself completing them and added it to the Trello card.  I can only hope its a version issue.  What else can you do, though, when you can't reproduce?
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
Honestly, the best thing I learned today was to just checkout another branch when my works proving too frustrating. 
<br>
<br>
I need to remember to do that more often.  I didn't like my feature, so what?  I know I can implement it, and more.  I know I have unreasonable expectations for myself.
<br>
<br>
Simply by switching to my bugFixes branch, I felt energized and more content with the work I got done today.  Something else I considered, but didn't do today, was to start checking out other team member's branches more often -- as in, not only when I'm asked to review a merge request.  Seeing what they're working on, peeking new features, would provide the same clarity
