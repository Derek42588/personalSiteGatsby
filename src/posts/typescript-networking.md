I opened up my IDE this morning, stared at it for a while, and was struck with a large lack of -- motivation is the wrong word.  I completed my GraphQL + Prisma + React boilerplate, and felt pretty great about it.  As far as where to go from there, though...
<br>
<br>
The only thing I could think of for days now was simply extending my previous game app idea, only now with a different framework and stack.  That's well and good, but it wasn't really inspiring me.  I <em>do</em> want to do a new project -- and soon -- but I want to feel passionate about it.  And while I see a lot of benefit in redoing my game app and ideas, I feel like I get to that level of energized, inspired work when exploring new ground.
<br>
<br>
I've got two main things I wanted to write about today in this blog.  First off, I'd just like to vent a bit about the general nightmare that is job hunting.
<br>
<br>

####Thanks for your application, \${drone-41923931}!
<br>
<br>
There's something uniquely dehumanizing about the endless monotony of applying for jobs. Filling out the same application five hundred million times. Having to input certian points of information twice, simply because the application was clearly done lazily. The incredibly shameless way that job posting boards all loop around and push you from one site to the next, all in the interest of forcing you to make yet another account and sign up for yet another job alert.

<br>
<br>
I've mentioned before that I've been trying to find a webinar/zoom meeting daily in the tech field on Meetup.com, in the hopes of using it as network opportunities. I've neglected that for a few days now, but today I joined one for Startups. I felt grimy as I took down the e-mails of all the CEO/CTO/COOs who presented and fired off my resume, portfolio and customized cover letter. There's something so fake to me about that hustler bullshit. Never stop grinding - make connections (who cares if they're fake) - give 110% at all times.
<br>
<br>
But at the same time, there's something real there. I <em>do</em> believe in networking, insofar as the value in two people actually getting to interact. People will care about me far more if we've exchanged even pleasantries, or have shared something even so trivial as having attended the same webinar.  
<br>
<br>
And I get anxious every night, feeling like I'm not doing enough to further my chances in making this career switch. I worked from 8-6 -- why aren't I working from 6-11 too? I'm spending time with my girlfriend watching Netflix -- why aren't I multitasking and reading a programming book at the same time??
<br>
<br>
I don't know what point I'm trying to make here, beyond letting off steam at the general process. It's frustrating when people list "Junior" positions that require 5 years of experience. It sucks when I feel like I have a decent portfolio, good competency, people skills, and so on, but can't even get past the resume screening. That's supposed to be the great equalizer of this field -- so long as you can code, you've got your foot in the door. I don't pretend that I'm an amazing candidate, but surely I could contribute to a team? I'm not experienced or fluent in tons of languages, but haven't I come very far in a relatively short amount of time? Doesn't that speak to the potential of quickly filling any gaps as I learn on the job?
<br>

####Typescript
<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, since I didn't really have a goal in mind, I decided to try a new course. Typescript has intrigued me for a while, and I started Stephen Grider's <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/">course</a> on it today.
<br>
<br>
I'm glad I did. I'm hoping it'll provide some inspiration for a new project, but even if not, I do see job listings that require knowledge in it. I get the feeling that it's one of those things that's still new enough that it hasn't become the norm (GraphQL), but the potential has people so excited that it's definitely something I'll be glad I learned down the road.
<br>
<br>
An initial, recurring thought was how much it reminded me of GraphQL. Explicitly defining types (and return types), structuring your data, so on.
<br>
<br>
I love the explicit errors. Being able to see certain things right in the IDE, without having to compile and run your code before, that could be enough on its own to sell me.  
<br>
<br>
I loved the typeDef documentation. In the course, we're using DefinitelyTyped libraries for various imports. Exploring a library this way, rather than its documentation, is new to me, but very, very cool. I feel like that's one thing I'll definitely be using over and over.
<br>
<br>
I'm not too deep into it yet, but I like how it just makes sense. The structures and patterns, writing them feels elegant.
<br>
<br>
I'm excited to keep going with it. Right now, a lot of the application feels a bit too 'best-practicey' for me. As in, when would I ever <em>really</em> benefit from using TS in my projects rather than JS? I'm sure that will become clearer as I learn more of it.
