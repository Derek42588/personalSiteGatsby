I continued with Andrei Neagoie's Complete React course today (which, for reasons I don't understand, is primarily taught by an instructor who works for him named Yihua Zhang).  That doesn't really matter, since Zhang is a good instructor.
<br>
<br>
I had a ton of fun today.  I feel like I'm really grasping a lot of the concepts that were eluding me before.  I worry a bit if I'm a bit like Monica in that episode of Friends where she is taking a beginner's cooking course -- of course I should know this stuff, I've been studying for about 18 months.
<br>
<br>
I don't think that should matter though, that's just doubts getting the best of me.  Coding is all about practice.  Not only that, while I'm only about 40% into this course, it definitely isn't just the basics.  I am hopeful that by the end of this course, I'll feel about it the way I do about Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and Sass course - where things finally 'clicked' with regards to React, but specifically Redux.

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
One thing that stuck out in particular today is the reselect library - I've never used this before, but it seems pretty critical.  Caching and memoizing store slices, why has no other course I've done yet gone over this?  Perhaps because they were only going over the Redux fundamentals, but still.  Seems like best practice to include this library and selector file structures.
<br>
<br>
Something that isn't particularly groundbreaking but that I'm definitely glad to be seeing more clearly - nested destructuring.  Props are so key, and by enforcing the best practice of destructuring off to the lowest level necessary really makes it clear in individual components
<br>
<br>
As a sidenote, I feel about five million times better at VSCode than I did maybe 3 months ago.  It's mostly been small pieces that I pick up while going through various courses -- emmet syntax, using ctrl+p to quickly open different files, searching the folder for functions to refactor things like mapStateToProps... so on and so on.  When I learn a new shortcut like that that I know I'll use over and over, it feels nearly as critical as a new programming concept.  Perhaps I'd benefit from a deep dive into the VSCode documents, but like I've said a million times, there's just <em>so</em> much to learn.  For now, learning through osmosis is getting the job done.
<br>
<br>
Finally, I can't remember if I've ever seen a ternary operator within a map function before or not, but it's definitely sticking with me now.  Array and object methods -- truly understanding them has opened up so many doors and made me feel much more confident.
