I drove back to our old apartment today, where my girlfriend and I will be staying until the end of the month.  The drive took around 6 hours, but I left first thing in the morning.  It was my intention to get to work when I got back, but to be honest, this whole weekend has just been draining.  For my coding work today, I decided to just continue the coding challenges from leetcode I've been writing about in the past few posts.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
I did... okay today.  I passed a few challenges, and failed a few others.  I know that if I peeked the challenges, it would click.  For now, though, I'd like to keep these 'open' and revisit, come back in a day or so and see if I can look at them in a different light.
<br>
<br>
They are getting more difficult, so that is nice.  I still feel as if I'd like to be finding more solutions that didn't involve reducers, forEaches, or for loops.  I guess, though, what else is there?  I should be looking more to the approved solutions of each question, to see what I could be branching out towards.
<br>
<br>
One thing I have noticed, though, is that I'm feeling more comfortable with reducer methods. They really aren't all that involved, but there was just something about their syntax that always got my brain twisted.  Having used them over and over in solutions, though, I feel confident with them now.
<br>
<br>
I find myself using the debugger statement inside my functions very often, when I want to clarify the order of operations, for lack of a better word.  I hope that in the future, I can see the code 'running' in my mind more clearly.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
Continuing with that thought above, while it isn't really 'clean' code, I've found that naming my pointer variables to make it much more clear in debugging what everything is at each stage of the loop its in.
<br>
<br>
I definitely felt like I revisted the value of typescript -- through frustration.  I was getting really annoyed with a certain method, when I had to wrap it what felt like a dozen times in checks against null.  At the same time, though, that's really reinforcing what could be breaking syntax further on in my call.  Am I still dealing with the data that I'm expecting?
