Continued work on a huge feature branch.  Tons of work with listeners to our Firebase DB, and monster logic in interpreting the doc changes (due to our not so easy to understand data structure).
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
There was one final tweak I had wanted to make, and then I was all set for testing.  I had assumed it would be at least a little challenging, but it turned out to not be bad at all, and added a huge chunk of functionality.
<br>
<br>
What I had hoped/assumed would be a victory lap round of testing turned into a nightmare.
<br>
<br>
Essentially, I think my issue stems from two async listeners that have to inform one another.  
<br>
<br>
####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
I am absolutely fried, and need a break.  I also wish I had more time to work...
