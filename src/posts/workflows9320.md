I should have known that by suggesting a different workflow for certain types of bugs (essentially, filtering out user error), I would place myself in charge of the dev side of it!  Haha.  
<br>
<br>
I don't mind though, really.  I know that I'd rather be in the thick of it than not.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
Since we've retooled our workflow a bit, today's team and dev meetings were devoted to finishing up bugfixes for this weeks sprint.  I worked on some more hotfixes, and think they came out pretty well.
<br>
<br>
We still need a little bit of finetuning on the tasks, though.  Honestly, half of what we did was better suited for feature work.  It's not a bug, and what we <em>should</em> focus on for this week is bugs in our new features that we created last week, not tacking on features at the last minute.
<br>
<br>
I mean, the one that I worked on was fairly trivial.  At the same time though, wouldn't dev time be better spent on tangible issues, ones where we know we have to do testing and work on, rather than something that doesn't even exist?
<br>
<br>
I'm nervous for the upcoming weeks.  We're going to be ejecting from Expo, which is a big surprise.  I had thought that would be a long while in the future, if at all.
<br>
<br>
That will definitely bring its own challenges, but I'm excited to add that experience as well.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
I think I should learn better ways of communicating with UX.  Their testing is absolutely critical, but often, things get lost in translation.  I wonder how I can improve.
