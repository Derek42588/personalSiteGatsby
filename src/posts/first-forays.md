####January 2019 - March 2019
<br>
<br>
During this time, I was working temp jobs and otherwise studying in all the free time I could spare.  At the recommendation of a friend, I started with Wes Bos' course <a href = "https://reactforbeginners.com/">React for Beginners</a>
<br>
<br>
Knowing what I do now, I definitely would have started elsewhere.  I didn't know enough about HTML/CSS, and I was basically just coding by numbers by following along and gaining the barest of understanding of the basics of react (props, state, etc)
<br>
<br>
Bos is a good teacher, but for someone else starting off - or looking to learn React for the first time - I'd recommend something else.  One, the course starts at $45 for the starter course and $69.50 for the master package (the one I took).  Courses on Udemy are constantly having sales to the point where they're $10 a class.  Bos might do the same, but I can't say that for sure.  Two, it definitely wasn't comprehensive.  
<br>
<br>
Granted, it's a beginner's course, but there are similar types of courses on Udemy that do a complete delve into a full language, library, etc., with 90+ hours of content and covering at least a bit of all of its facets.  This course, for example, doesn't touch Redux, Hooks, and more.
<br>
<br>
What I did learn, though, was how powerful React could be.  It's fast, compact, powerful, and not too hard to dive into.  If you're interested in the end project of the course, github repo <a href = "https://github.com/Derek42588/CatchOfTheDay">here</a>.

<br>
<br>
If I were starting over, I think I'd begin with a HTML + CSS course, and then move onto one for JavaScript.  The downsides to this, I'd think, are that you don't really get much of a sense of accomplishment with HTML/CSS projects.  You're limited in what you can do, and everyone and their mother can write it.  Moreover, you could just as easily produce something just as good -- or better -- with something like SquareSpace or Wordpress without even having to learn anything.
<br>
<br>

####Pitfalls
<br>
<br>
If I had to categorize my first year of self study (and probably still a bit now), the biggest challenge was probably not feeling like I was advancing fast enough.  Some of that is my own mindset, given that I'm really motivated to get into this as a career, and I'd like it to have happened yesterday than take any longer than necessary.  But like I mentioned above, when you're first starting and learning all the fundamentals, really good, powerful projects/apps seem so far away.
<br>
<br>
Of course, having to learn the basics is unavoidable.  There's no shortcut you can take.  I imagine even after I get a job and have been working for a while I'll still feel like there's so much I don't know and still need to learn.  I guess the short of it is, you need to be able to self-motivate really well.  It will be discouraging, you'll write something and work on a project for months or more and it will end up looking terrible and barely doing anything special.
<br>
<br>
You'll be able to write an authentication loop, for example, and then try to apply the basics from that into something a little different and have it not work at all.  You'll get lost in documentation and googling stackoverflow -- half of the answers outdated, don't apply to your situation, and make you more confused than before you searched.

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
From this portion of my time of study, I think the most important thing I learned was how much I didn't know.  I reached the end of the React Beginners' course, couldn't apply any of it to something of my own, and realized I wouldn't be able to just pick up React and then snag some sweet job the next day.  The most important part was learning that I needed to just keep learning, always.  Pick the next language/concept/course and keep going.
