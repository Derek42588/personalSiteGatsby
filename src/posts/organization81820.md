Today was stressful, but I feel good about the work.  We have the pressure way up, because the CEO is ready to launch.  He and the Biz Dev teams have also made launch date promises, and we're either missing or fudging them at this point.
<br>
<br>
Problem is, we're still getting some bugs and crashes.  Worse still, I can almost never recreate them.  The goal right now is to get another new build out, with as few bugs and crashes as possible (ideally none, but, well...), and once thats out do a soft launch to try and gain users and pitch for funding.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
I spent the morning working on a feature that was on my sprint, and made good progress.  Unfortunately, that came off the rails when I attended the usability meeting in the afternoon, where it was clear the current feelings of the app and the errors that we're getting.
<br>
<br>
A huge, huge issue is, as mentioned above, I simply can't recreate many of them.  Another is that we've moved towards rotating our DBs, test to live and etc, and I can't be sure that isn't throwing issues.  I'd like to be, but I have to much on my plate at the moment to spend too much time on DB and we have an entire DB team.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, for the rest of the day I worked hard on bug catching, and feel like I made a lot of progress.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
We're too young a company to really have 'legacy' code, but man is it important to really bring up ALL aspects of the code to date.  It's so easy to neglect things that are just working...until they don't, and cause dozens of issues.
<br>
<br>
I really enjoy helping people.  I like teaching...though of course, I don't feel like I have much I can really teach someone, unless they're literally just starting out.  But I could teach a lot about this <em>specific</em> project, so that gives me hope that in my next company, I could get up to speed fairly quickly and be a contributing member.
