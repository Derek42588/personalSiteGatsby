snippetText: "I decided to have another light day today.  We're still not getting much feedback from UX as to any crashing and breaking bugs, and to be honest, I know that once we release this week and start trying to build a userbase, things will get crazy.  So, no feature work for me today."

Back to feature work today.  We had our company wide meeting as usual, where we're preparing for a wide launch as soon as we get App Store approval.  Afterwards, we had a bi-weekly dev meeting, where we went over sprints.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
I've been advocating for it for a while, so I was assigned finishing work on sorting and filtering certain documents.
<br>
<br>
I feel bad that another member of the dev team got assigned something that I had been working on myself (before diverted with bug fixes last week).  I did push my latest work and pinged him the branch, so hopefully that helps him out.  I think I'd appreciate the same, so hopefully it doesn't feel for him like <em>my</em> work was dumped on him.
<br>
<br>
The combined meetings took a few hours, so for tonight, I only had an hour or two to really play around with the feature.  I think I've got the filter working like desired, but of course, it opened up a whole bunch of things that need to be tweaked.  For instance, we're kind of expecting the app to auto refresh when we go through X amount of documents.  When we're filtering, though, we want that to be a user action.
<br>
<br>
Nothing too terrible.  There are some points that will take some design.  To be honest, though, I'm just going to ignore design considerations to begin with.  First off, I'm not focusing on front end here.  Second, I'd rather just submit it, have it get torn apart by UX/UI, and then work on requested changes after.  The actual functionality is what I'd like to focus on first.
<br>
<br>
We discussed a lot of long term decisions today.  For one, I believe we eventually want to be SQL, as I've mentioned before.  While we talked about it, I thought about my own implementations.  By far, what I enjoyed the most was the Docker + GraphQL + PostgreSQL projects I've mentioned a few times.
<br>
<br>
I wonder if in my spare time, I should try to spin up a mock up of our DB, but in that format.  I think it'd be a good challenge for me.  I'm often afraid of atrophying skills.  For instance, I've been so focused with RN, that what I learned with GraphQL and SQL are a little unclear.
