####May 2019 - December 2019
<br>
<br>
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  I knew a bit of React, JS, HTML and CSS.  Where's my job, right?!  Well, I still couldn't really do much.  A lot of advice you get while starting is just keep making projects, always work on more, new, better.
<br>
<br>
That is excellent advice, but self-teaching by piecemeal, you run into a lot of walls.  Especially as at this time, I was still working full time, and just trying to code every free moment I had.  I worked 9-5, and my commute was roughly 90 minutes.  I'd wake up around 4:30 or 5AM, code for a few hours, and then head to work.  I tried to code after work, but I found mornings were much better for me being able to cocncentrate.
<br>
<br>
Coding on my commute (public transit) also was never very good.  I snuck in some easy work here and there, when I could bring my laptop, but otherwise it would be hard to focus and of course, without having wifi and not wanting to burn massive data by hotspotting my phone, I was limited in what I could do or reference.  Other than that, I would study about 6-8 hours each day on weekends.
<br>
<br>
One of the things I've realized over and over is to recognize when you simply don't know enough, and then identify what you can do to fix that.  I still had basic knowledge, but little else.  Very little practical experience, and a lot of difficulty in doing anything more than little snippets, modeling off of course code-alongs.
<br>
<br>

####Focused Study
<br>
<br>
So I needed to know more, do better.  I set two main goals for myself: I would dive much, much deeper into React, and I would complete one, big, comprehensive project.
<br>
<br>
As I mentioned in <a href = "/posts/introductory-post/">my first post</a>, some of the CS knowledge I had prior to this journey was completing most of the University of Helsinki's Massive Open Online Course on Java.  Then, early last year, they released their "Full Stack Open".  It covers React, Redux, Node, Mongo, GraphQL in one course, segmented into parts focusing on each one and building on the last.  When I took it last year, it did not have TypeScript.  Since I've finished, they've now added a module for it on their 2020 version.  You can find the course <a href = "https://fullstackopen.com/en/">here</a>
<br>
<br>
I would definitely say that this course, along with the project I would work on afterwards, were the biggest steps forward I took.  The course is filled with exercises, check ins, challenges and more.  It builds your knowledge on all of its modules one at a time, and then challenges you to pull the all together.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
If I were giving advice to someone else, starting out, and to help them do better than I did, it would be to start with a course on HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  There are multiple, excellent choices on Udemy and other platforms.  Then I would absolutely do this course.  It's challenging, but very, very good.
<br>
<br>
It was difficult to complete while doing it part time, and I worked on it for months at the above-mentioned schedule.  My <a href = "https://github.com/Derek42588/">Github</a> has multiple repositories on my own solutions to every one of the modules (except the aforementioned recently added TypeScript section, though I might go back and complete that at some point in the future).
<br>
<br>
For someone near the same level in their own self-teaching, I definitely recommend a similar app.  Find something small, but still somewhat robust.  Have it do one central thing, but do it fully, from beginning to end.  But by the time I finished it, while I would still have glaring holes in my skillsets, I was able to complete the app I was most proud of up to this point in my career, and helped me gain a little bit of confidence, which can be incredibly hard to find while starting out.  The project in question I'll go over in detail in tomorrow's post.
