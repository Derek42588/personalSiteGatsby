####March 2020 - May 2020
<br>
<br>
We're finally almost caught up to current!  So by this point, I've been laid off due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and have decided to focus completely on studying programming and trying to obtain a junior dev job.  
<br>
<br>
I'm very excited about the next two things I learned, not the least of which is that they were done more recently (within the past 2 months), and as such, is a little easier to write about since it's fresh in my mind.
<br>
<br>

####Sass
<br>
<br>
CSS has always been a struggle (and will remain so).  Something about it... I don't know what it is.  It's not exactly a challenging language, but I think that because it's relatively unexciting (adds nothing to functionality -- the sexy part of development -- only to form), certain concepts stick less in my mind. 
<br>
<br>
I've mentioned it in a few other posts, but I cannot recommend Jonas Schmedtmann's <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/">Advanced CSS and Sass</a> any higher.  Not only did certain concepts (foremost, Grid) finally stick for me after taking this one, I've fallen in love with Sass and can't even imagine writing CSS without it (I have yet to use Less, though plan to at least check it out).
<br>
<br>
I can definitely say that the idea of going back and making websites' designs responsive and mobile-compatible was always daunting.  Sass and a few other key concepts I learned from this course (global defaults, starting with rem, mixins) made it easy and even fun.  Now working on responsivity isn't just a chore, it's something I enjoy doing.
<br>
<br>
One of my hobbies is playing an older video game, Asheron's Call.  I play on a private, player run server.  This server needed a hub site for information, a wiki, and a few API needs (an ELO ranking, for example).  You can find it on my projects page, and also <a href = "http://www.acriptide.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
This was my first project after learning Sass and applying the advanced CSS concepts I learned in Schmedtmann's course, and I'm very proud of it.  I know I can still improve in certain areas of design, mainly color scheming, perhaps using more animations (I tend to find them busy and unnecessary, but they do have their place), and a few other areas.  But after taking this course, I definitely have the confidence that I can design websites that are clean, functional, and professional looking.

####Gatsby
<br>
<br>
I had read a few articles on Gatsby, and decided it sounded interesting and wanted to check it out.  My chief interest was that I'd like to also be able to do static sites, if any future projects need it (particularly for SEO reasons).  Secondarily, I wanted to use it to make a blog (this one!). I could, of course, hardcode it into an SPA app, but somehow that felt like cheating.  Using Gatsby to generate static sites for a feature like a blog seemed like a perfect fit.
<br>
<br>
I took Reed Barger's <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-gatsby-masterclass/learn/">The Gatsby Masterclass</a>, and it was definitely fine for my purposes.  I think if someone wanted to learn Gatsby as their primary tool, I might recommend a longer/more comprehensive course.  Barger's is more of an overview.  Gatsby's documentation is excellent, however, and as such if you're comfortable with a few languages and self-starting from documentation, Barger's course is a great choice.
<br>
<br>
I've skipped over a few parts, but we're finally up to today!  Future blog posts will now cover any new courses I take, or otherwise, trying to write about at least one new thing I've learned every day.  Some things I'm considering checking out soon: Prism, Vue, Angular.
