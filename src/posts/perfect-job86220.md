I did more feature work today, but I wanted to write about something different for tonight's blog post.  I've been chatting more frequently in my friend's discord, where there's a channel for people who are professional programmers.  It's got me thinking more about applying for jobs and what I'll have to do next after this internship.

A couple people shared interview questions, which was great.  I always prefer to see real-world examples.  One was very easy,and though I had a correct solution, I only realized later that night that there was a better one.  Of course, that's part of the test.  I'll have to remember to try and catch mylelf after the first correct solution I come up with, to see if there are obvious improvements.

Another was very hard.  Essentially, he was tasked with creating a react native app from scratch, utilizing TypeScript and GraphQL.  Now, I think I could do that.  He said that he had only 2 days to make it, though.  Maybe I'll try and take a weekend off from work soon and give myself the same challenge.  Or, tweak the use of it to make it more personal, but keep the overall heirarchy and level of features.

I'm rambling a little bit, since what I wanted this post to be was a reflection on what I would think as a perfect job at this point.  I'd love to keep expanding in the stack I work with now.  I'd love for it to be React (or better, React Native and they buy me a macbook).  I'd love to get back to GraphQL.

I'd like it to be low on chaos.  What I mean by that is, I don't really mind pressure.  I get a lot of pride from fulfilling my assigned tasks.  I would like to continue working in the startup sphere, but maybe on a product that has already launched.  It's hard when you're always pivoting, always adding new features, always adding more <em>do or die</em> deadlines.  Maybe that's always the case though?

I'd love to be a junior member where I can't really break much for a while.  I need to learn from people above me.  I definitely do learn from my dev team lead now, but it's more of the intangibles, less of the specific tech stack.  That would be nice.
<br>
<br>
In the end though, I would just love any (paying) job at all.
