Continuing on with TypeScript, I'd like to first start with a shout out for the course I'm currently taking, Stephen Grider's <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/">Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide</a>.
<br>
<br>
There are basically two categories of courses I work through, that will make me consider them a favorite of mine.  First is one where the work itself is so demonstrative of the underlying idea, that it complete ignites my imagination, and inspires me to create my next project.  
<br>
<br>
The second, that this and every Grider course I've taken so far, is the second category: where the instruction is so good, I'm constantly finding myself 'working ahead' -- inspired by the snippets of what is being taught, my mind goes into overdrive and I'm wanting to refactor everything, and test the ideas out in new code snippets and scenarios.  Obviously, in both scenarios, having a great instructor goes without saying.
<br>
<br>

####The Work
<br>
<br>
The premise of the next chunk of work in this course is intriguing, and one I hadn't yet come across in the dozen plus courses I've already worked through: creating a framework.
<br>
<br>
Such an excellent prompt for showing what TypeScript can do, and to learn the key concepts. Essentially, we'll be making a complete (albeit light and barebones) framework, and then creating a web app utilizing it and nothing else. Instead of a React Component, say, we'll be using the Models, Views, and Containers we define.
<br>
<br>
I'm really excited, and hope I can get through the remainder of this course quickly. I hesitate to say it until I actually put it into action, but it's my personal hope that I use TS exclusively from now on.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
I learned a lot more about inheritance and composition than I had ever really had use for before.  
<br>
<br>
Every time I see something new about TypeScript's syntax, it just makes sense. Today, one thing that sticks out is how to initialize an empty object in a class.  
<br>
<br>
In one of the exercises, I was working ahead, and it occurred to me what I was looking for would benefit from memoization. I figured I could implement a cache in the class, and as I worked through the function, make use of memoization for general performance optimization.
<br>
<br>
When I tried to logically write out how that would be represented using what I already knew, TS lit up with errors. I had just never seen the syntax of [key: string] yet, but I know it now. I'm sure I could have figured it out with googling, but as it wasn't necessary for my work at that point, I just moved on and utilized a different solution. The course happened to go over it at a later point.
<br>
<br>
I'd like to get some more concrete, real-world examples of using TS. Thankfully, this portion of the course seems to fulfil that. I think I can also trawl Github afterwards and try to find some little web app projects that utilize TypeScript, and clone and play around with them.
