####Triplebyte Interview
<br>
<br>
I finally had my first live coding interview.  Unfortunately, it wasn't with a company, but with Triplebyte -- who I'm sure anyone who's looking to start a career in development has heard of.  I am very glad to have gotten it over with, though.
<br>
<br>
It began when I decided on a whim to do their test this morning.  I went through their Front End quiz, and passed.  Afterwards, I was offered the "fast track" live, 2-hour interview.  I'm not sure if this is offered to only people above a certain percentile, or just a marketing ploy, but I decided to try it out.
<br>
<br>
The quiz wasn't too bad, and I feel was a good test of general front end knowledge.  The live interview was definitely nerve-wracking, but I'm sure that's just because it was my first one.  The first part was just a screen cast of me coding through a quick app prompt -- mine was a mock trello board.  
<br>
<br>
I definitely absolutely blanked at first.  I was able to use my own environment and boilerplate, which I had pre-set up with my Sass the way I liked it.  There were a few minutes where my CSS wasn't loading at all, I wasn't accomplishing anything, and felt like I was gonna crash and burn before I did anything at all.  
<br>
<br>
Thankfully, things kicked in and I was able to do -- I think -- okay on this part. I didn't finish the prompt, but to be honest, you're not given that much time.  I got as much done as I could.
<br>
<br>
The next part was an oral exam of general front end concepts.  This part I feel like I did way worse at.  There were tons of points in the interview where I was saying "I don't know".  It was both better and worse than I was expecting.  There weren't any quizzes on random algorithms or concepts, but there were a lot of questions on concepts that -- in my opinion at least -- weren't things a front=end developer really needs to know.
<br>
<br>
Overall I would call it a good experience, and their process is fair and enjoyable.  I just hope I can reach the point where I'm more confident in these types of interviews.  To be honest, I think my biggest strength won't be on the theoretical for a long while.  I <em>do</em> think that level of knowledge will come, but only with time and experience.  Studying on your own and making personal projects can't really teach you some of what they're asking.
<br>
<br>
If nothing else, I would absolutely recommend doing their interview for people trying to strike out in the field just for the experience of doing a coding interview alone.

####Game Project
<br>
<br>
The rest of my time today was spent on my current project, which is coming along nicely!  I'm ironing out a working "game instance", and getting a lot of the live updates + firebase listeners working well.  Right now I'm working on an instance-specific chat function.  After that, I feel like I want to sketch out some design basics and then get onto the meat of applying the logic (a good deal pre-written) working with the live database and with multiplayer.
<br>
<br>
Definitely chugging along.  Two days ago, I would have had doubts I'd be able to do the project all.  Now, I'm confident I can have a finished product ready by next week.
<br>
<br>

####What I Learned
<br>
<br>
Do as many interviews as you possibly can.
<br>
<br>
Study some common interview question books/courses.
<br>
<br>
Live testing is very difficult (hah - of course).  In my next project, it would probably be worthwhile to set up some more nuanced testing environments for interacting with the database.
